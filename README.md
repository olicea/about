## What can you expect from me?

I have found that people are successful when they support each other, I am a manager who is here to unblock you and help you succeed and collaborate, open the door, and sometimes gently push you into the door

My role is: 
* Unblock you and Trust you to do your job
* Provide you with a safe environment to grow
* Give you timely feedback, both positive and constructive
* Provide the resources you need to do your job
* Challenge you in ways that will help you grow
* Champion your accomplishments and echo it to anyone who will listen
* Provide a safe environment for you to tell me what can I do better

My role is not to:
* Do your job for you
* Shield you from constructive feedback
* Enable destructive behaviors

## What do I expect from my team?

* Practice Kindness: We succeed as a team. Helping others with designs, code reviews, unblocking, load balancing, etc. is important. 
  * Grow everyone to be independent. Don't be a blocker on other people's work. Your impact is multiplied by helping others succeed.
  * The people in our team, organization, and company are more important than any date or deliverable.
* Global Product, Global Team: Everyone should feel included, valued, and comfortable being their authentic selves on the team. We are a distributed team and practice remote first. We strive to include everyone's communication and work preferences 
* Growth mindset: Be willing to experiment and change, make mistakes and learn.
* Ship to Learn: Find the right balance between asking for help and doing things yourself. Donâ€™t waste your time when someone can unblock you quickly.
* Trust by Default: Trust is given, not earned. By the customs of the rest of the world, we overtrust each other, and we are comfortable with that.

## What do I expect from myself?

* I smy team the best it can be?
* Am I doing the best I can do?
* Are we shipping a great product?

* What is falling through the cracks?
